# home-automation-raspi
Home automation system based on raspberry pi.

Basic website hosted on the raspberry pi. I am able to control a camera and the GPIO pins from the web. Plus the website is accessible from the outside by port forwarding.

I am able to:
- take pictures by executing commands on the raspberry via PHP
- turn on lights / coffe maker by plugging an electrical 12V relay that I control with the GPIO pins. I plug an extension cord to an electrical socket and put the electrical relay in the middle of the circuit so I am able to cut and open it remotely.
- Work in progress: set up a NAS and access files (movies, pictures...) that are located on the raspberry pi remotely. And set up my own streaming system.
